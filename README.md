<br>
This course is focused on the server-side <br>
part of coding. Interesting and various <br>
servers to make this course a great <br>
learning tool in back-end coding.

## Week 1 and 2:
  
  * `Node.js and NPM`
  * `Node Modules`
  * `Node and the HTTP module`
  * `Express, REST API, Express generator`
  * `MongoDB, MongooseODM`
   
## Week 3 and 4:

  * `REST API with MongoDB, Express and Mongoose`
  * `Authentication`
  * `Cookies`
  * `User-Authentication with passport`
  * `Mongoose Population`
  * `HTTPS and Secure communication`
  * `OAuth with passport and facebook`
  * `Loopback, Data sources and Access control`
   

### Additional information:
-------------------------------
  
I had some trouble with a previous repository, so I just made a new one <br>
to make it easier and less work, since I started this course abit behind schedule. <br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course is now finnished, and just to inform you; I skipped the last part of the course, due to some problems <br>
that the MongoDB server gave me, and I couldn't find a fix for it that wouldn't take me weeks to do. <br>
I simply didn't have the time to fix/do it, but I hope you will manage to.
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  I also found some useful links to update the repository from <strong>gitBash</strong> to make <br>
  merging changes to this repository easier than adding singular files:
  
* `$ git add .`
* `$ git commit -m "made some changes"`
* `$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourreponame.git`
* `$ git push origin master`
