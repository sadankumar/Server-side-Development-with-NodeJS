### Additional information:

  I had some trouble with a previous repository, so I just made a new one <br>
  to make it easier and less work, since I started this course abit behind schedule. <br>
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I also found some useful links to update the repository from <strong>gitBash</strong> to make <br>
  merging changes to this repository easier than adding singular files:
  
* `$ git add .`
* `$ git commit -m "made some changes"`
* `$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourreponame.git`
* `$ git push origin master`
